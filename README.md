**Please note: WCSAxes has now been [merged into Astropy](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/visualization/wcsaxes/index.html)!**

WCSAxes is a package that makes it easy to plot images with world coordinate
system (WCS) information (which translates pixel to 'world' coordinates and
back) using [Matplotlib](http://www.matplotlib.org). Originally intended for
use with Astronomical data, WCSAxes can be used with any data provided that an
appropriate WCS transformation is supplied.

This is an implementation of the API described
[here](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-api/blob/master/wcs_axes/wcs_api.md).

At the moment the implementation has not be optimized for performance. Once all
the functionality is in place, and a test suite has been created, the code will
be refactored and optimized.
